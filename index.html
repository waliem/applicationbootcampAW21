  <center><h1> What is an API? </h1>

<p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is the system that we communicate<br> with when we put in requests through our applications or websites. We can’t talk to the internal system in the back<br> aka servers or databases. we can only communicate with the API layer.
Let’s say you want to know what the weather is <br>gonna be in Gothenburg tomorrow so you open your weather application. The weather application<br> sends a request through the internet to an API requesting a weather prognosis for tomorrow in the chosen city.<br> the API furthers the request to the the server or database that stores the weather prognosis information.<br> once the information has been located it will output the weather information back through <br>the API and appear in your application with tomorrows weather.
